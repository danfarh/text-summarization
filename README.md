# Abstractive Text Summarization Fine-Tuning on T5 Model
## About The Project
  This repository contains the code for fine-tuning the T5 model for abstractive text summarization on xsum dataset. The T5 model is a transformer-based language model developed by Google, which is known for its state-of-the-art performance on several natural language processing tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the XSum dataset, which is a collection of news articles and their corresponding summaries.

## Approach
The project will use a machine learning approach to generate summaries of a given text. The following steps will be taken:
- Data Preparation: The dataset will be preprocessed and cleaned to remove any noise and irrelevant information.
- Fine-tuning T5 Model: The pre-trained T5 model will be fine-tuned on the XSum dataset to generate summaries of news articles.
- Model Evaluation: The model will be evaluated on a test set to measure its accuracy and other performance metrics.

## Requirements
- Python 
- HuggingFace Transformers library
- PyTorch 
- Pandas
- NumPy
